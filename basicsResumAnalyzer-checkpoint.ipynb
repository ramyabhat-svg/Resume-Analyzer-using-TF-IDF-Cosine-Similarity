      "It is observed that plastic bucket kept in sunlight and rain for long time loses its lustre and \n",

      "are reused for the makin g if new product.  \n",
      "Pollution is minimized : this is one of the major attractions of recycling of batteries. Since it is \n",
      "abundantly found, it is very important to recycle as it is non-biodegradable . This reduces pollution \n",
      "to a great extent . \n",
      "Job opportunities : a lot of job opportunities are created in the recycling industry. Right from \n",
      "collection of batteries from waste dumping areas and collection centres  till the delivery of the final \n",
      "product to the market, a lot of opportunities are created.  \n",
      "Environment becomes clean : the cleanliness of the surrounding increases as very little waste is \n",
      "dumped. This has a positive impact on the environment. This in turn protects the biodiversity.  \n",
      "Reduces global warming : the dumping of waste and its burning causes  emission of various toxin \n",
      "gases like sulphur , carbon, nitrogen and so on. This gets absorbed into the atmosphere which in \n",
      "turn triggers glo bal warming and climate change.  \n",
      "Disadvantages of battery recycling  \n",
      "• The value of the recycled products is comparativ ely low as compared to newer products.  \n",

      "environmental Economists David W. Pears and R. Kerry Turner introduced the circular economic \n",
      "system . \n",
      "A circular economy not only minimizes wastes by closing the pro ducts and/or material loops in \n",
      "the industrial ecosystem; but it also changes the economic logic by replacing ‘ production’ with  \n",
      "‘sufficiency’ by the means of reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling . \n",
      "The Conventional Economic System was based on linear models where natural resources were \n",
      "exploited and converted into some products which were to become waste eventually. There was \n",
      "no flexibility in crafting and design of products so that they could be reused or recycled. On the \n",
      "other hand, the Circular Economy Approach works on an innovative economic model to tackle the \n",
      "global crises of pollution, loss of biodi versity, climate change and e -waste management.  \n",
      "A circular economy approach favours closed loop systems where resources are employed carefully \n",
      "to create innovative products which can be used for longer periods of time by reusing, sharing, \n",
      "refurbishing and recycling. Longer periods and smart design also imply greater productivity. \n",
